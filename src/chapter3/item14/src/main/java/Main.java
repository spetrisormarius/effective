public class Main {

//    In the following description, the notation sgn(expression) designates the mathematical
//    signum function, which is defined to return -1, 0, or 1, according to
//    whether the value of expression is negative, zero, or positive.
//            • The implementor must ensure that sgn(x.compareTo(y)) == -sgn(y.
//    compareTo(x)) for all x and y. (This implies that x.compareTo(y) must
//    throw an exception if and only if y.compareTo(x) throws an exception.)
//            • The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive: (x.
//            compareTo(y) > 0 && y.compareTo(z) > 0) implies x.compareTo(z) > 0.
//            • Finally, the implementor must ensure that x.compareTo(y) == 0 implies that
//    sgn(x.compareTo(z)) == sgn(y.compareTo(z)), for all z.
//            • It is strongly recommended, but not required, that (x.compareTo(y) == 0)
//            == (x.equals(y)). Generally speaking, any class that implements the
//    Comparable interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this
//    fact. The recommended language is “Note: This class has a natural ordering
//            that is inconsistent with equals.”
