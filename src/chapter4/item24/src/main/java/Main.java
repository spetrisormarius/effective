public class Main {

//    If you declare a member class that does not require access to an enclosing
//            instance, always put the static modifier in its declaration, making it a static
//    rather than a nonstatic member class. If you omit this modifier, each instance will
//    have a hidden extraneous reference to its enclosing instance. As previously mentioned,
//    storing this reference takes time and space.
